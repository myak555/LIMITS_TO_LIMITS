# Carbon fuel production calibration file
#
# data obtained from:
#    BP World Energy Report, 2018
#    Energy Information Administration: www.eia.gov
#
# gas and coal production are converted to metric ton of oil equivalent (toe)
# conversion factors as per BP World Energy Report
# estimated accuracy, by the difference between 2015 and 2016 reports, is 3-5%
# Canada bitumen production in 2020 is estimated at 165.1 mln tonn based on
# monthly tar sand reports
