# USE OF NOAA GML DATA
# 
# These data are made freely available to the public and the
# scientific community in the belief that their wide dissemination
# will lead to greater understanding and new scientific insights.
# The availability of these data does not constitute publication
# of the data.  NOAA relies on the ethics and integrity of the user to
# ensure that GML receives fair credit for their work.  If the data 
# are obtained for potential use in a publication or presentation, 
# GML should be informed at the outset of the nature of this work.  
# If the GML data are essential to the work, or if an important 
# result or conclusion depends on the GML data, co-authorship
# may be appropriate.  This should be discussed at an early stage in
# the work.  Manuscripts using the GML data should be sent to GML
# for review before they are submitted for publication so we can
# ensure that the quality and limitations of the data are accurately
# represented.

# RECIPROCITY
# 
# Use of these data implies an agreement to reciprocate.
# Laboratories making similar measurements agree to make their
# own data available to the general public and to the scientific
# community in an equally complete and easily accessible form.
# Modelers are encouraged to make available to the community,
# upon request, their own tools used in the interpretation
# of the GML data, namely well documented model code, transport
# fields, and additional information necessary for other
# scientists to repeat the work and to run modified versions.
# Model availability includes collaborative support for new
# users of the models.

# Uncertainties in the global annual means are estimated using two
# terms: The first is a bootstrap (resampling) method that varies the
# sites in our network. Each pseudo-network contains the same number of
# sites as our actual NOAA ESRL cooperative global air sampling network,
# but some are repeated and some are excluded. The second term is a
# Monte Carlo method that randomly modifies the data to account for
# measurement uncertainty. In both cases, 100 globally-averaged time
# series are created. Standard deviations of the annual means are
# calculated, and the two terms (network and analytical) are taken in
# quadrature to give the  reported uncertainties. Please see Dlugokencky
# et al., 1994, JGR, vol. 99, 17021-17043, for a complete discussion.
# CH4 is reported in units of dry-air mole fraction, nanomol/mol,
# abbreviated, ppb.

#
# NOTE: In general, the data presented for the last year are subject to change,
# depending on recalibration of the reference gas mixtures used, and other quality
# control procedures. Occasionally, earlier years may also change for the same
# reasons.  Usually these changes are minor.
# 
# Based on the historical evidence of performance, the data is only trustworthy within +/-2 ppb or 0.1%.
# For the numeric presentations, the absolute values should be rounded up to the nearest whole ppb,
# E.g. if 1984 reads "1644.66", use "1645", if 1985 reads "1657.26", use "1657".
