# CO2 emission calibration file
#
# data obtained from:
#    BP World Energy Report â€“ 2018
#    Energy Information Administration: www.eia.gov
#
# conversion factors:
# coal 3.96 tCO2/toe
# oil  3.07 tCO2/toe
# gas  2.35 tCO2/toe
# cement estimated at 200 mln t carbon in 2015, with a tail of 0.94
#
# note that tCO2/tCarbon = 2*16.00/12.01 + 1 = 3.66
# Accuracy of the total result +- 15%
